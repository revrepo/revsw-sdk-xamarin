The SDK is a simple way to connect a Xamarin mobile application to nuu:bit global content acceleration and analytics platform.
  

The nuu:bit SDK provides 3 main areas of functionality designed to provide the optimal mobile app experience. These areas are:
  

- Mobile analytics designed to provide key backend and network performance data back to application developers 
- Network-level optimization backed by the nuu:bit global acceleration network designed to speed up the delivery of content through changing mobile network conditions 
- App-level control of the nuu:bit caching network using analytics to provide an optimized CDN-caching system regardless of location or network conditions.
